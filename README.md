# Mini-Project-C-2022

## Overview

This project has been developed by Ahmed Malek Tlili, Mohamed Ali Hentati, and Mahdi Barhoumiâ€”three motivated engineering students at ENSI (National School of Computer Science) in Tunisia. As a dedicated and ambitious group, we have a shared passion for studying computer science.

Our project is a stock management system implemented in C, leveraging dynamic allocation features along with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions. The program utilizes file and array data structures to efficiently manage stock information.

## Instructions

Before you run the executable program, please take a moment to read our notes carefully. We've included important information and insights to ensure a smooth understanding of the application.
